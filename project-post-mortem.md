## Project Post Mortem
Post mortems are important to understand about what happened in a project and actively think about what you learned.

Post-mortems are meant to be a blame-less space open to objective conversation about what went well and what could be improved.

Even in the examples below, where tens of millions of dollars could be lost, the best approach is to think through the series of events that led to the outcome.

Large mistakes are almost never the fault of the developer, but of the sytems and processes in place to prevent errors and problems.

### What to Bring
Please answer the following questions. Take at least 30 minutes to prepare.

#### Approach and Process

1. What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?

    #### More planning and research before starting on the projects. Need to start working faster too.

1. What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?

    #### Got into the groove of working much quicker than before. Debugging and googling issues has become easier too.

#### Code and Code Design

1. What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

    #### I would like to be more daring with what I want to do and push myself to learn more things. I also scaffolded something wrong but I just went with it.


1. What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?

    #### Okay la I think getting used to partials and its merits. Like low key proud of figuring the administrator account stuff.

  For each, please include code examples.
  1. Code snippet up to 20 lines.
  2. Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

#### SEI Unit 4 Post Mortem
1. What habits did I use during SEI that helped me, that I will take on to my future coding projects?

    #### Self-directed learning. Finding resources online. 

2. What habits did I have during SEI I can improve on that I will try to change on future projects?

    #### Self-disicipline and motivation. I don't think I deal with hurdles very well but this recent project has gotten me to take things in stride.
    
3. How is the overall level of the course overall? (instruction, course materials, etc.)

    #### I think the course is great all things considered. Looking back 12 weeks ago to now, I can do so much more than I did before.
